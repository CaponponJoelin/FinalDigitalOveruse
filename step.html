    <h2>Step 1: Dilemma</h2>
    <p>The first step is awareness. You need to recognize that you’ve become too attached to your devices. Ask yourself: Do you want to be productive and live a fulfilling life, or stay stuck chasing a fake reality? Awakening is crucial — you must wake up and convince yourself to change. Stop letting temporary distractions dictate your life.
    </p>
    <h2>Step 2: Diversion</h2>
    <p>Manage your time intentionally. Limit your use of digital devices to 5–10% of your day. Prioritize meaningful activities and create a balanced schedule. Step outside, get some sunlight, and refresh your mind. Real-life experiences will help you regain control and improve your mood.</p>
    <h2>Step 3: Discover</h2>
    <p>Boredom fuels mindless scrolling. Fill that gap with meaningful hobbies. Try physical activities like jogging, swimming, or yoga to boost your energy. Explore creative outlets like painting, writing, or music. Develop practical skills like cooking, programming, or learning a new language. Join a club or volunteer to build real connections. Life is meant to be experienced — find what excites you and grow from it.
